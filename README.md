# Project 1: Simulation of Backup Camera with Dynamic Trajectory of Rear Wheels
Overview
This project simulates a backup camera's view with a dynamic trajectory of rear wheels using a 10-second clip from a phone recording. The simulation involves making assumptions about steering geometry, vehicle dimensions, and overlaying the trajectory on the video. The goal is to test the application of knowledge in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) software development and vehicle dynamics while incorporating basic object classification.

Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

project1_main.py: The main script for simulating the backup camera view and overlaying the rear wheel trajectory.
project1_utils.py: Utility functions used in the simulation.
project1_Video.mp4: Input video file for the simulation.
project1_output.avi: Output video file with the overlaid trajectory.
Installation
