## Project 1: Simulation of Backup Camera with Dynamic Trajectory of Rear Wheels

### Overview

This project simulates a backup camera's view with a dynamic trajectory of rear wheels using a 10-second clip from a recording. The simulation involves making assumptions about steering geometry, vehicle dimensions, and overlaying the trajectory on the video.

### Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `Backup camera.py`: The main script for simulating the backup camera view and overlaying the rear wheel trajectory.
- `Video.mp4`: Input video file for the simulation.
- `output.avi`: Output video file with the overlaid trajectory.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/Amoghaananthu/Backup-camera-simulation-and-vehicle-detection.git)https://github.com/Amoghaananthu/Backup-camera-simulation-and-vehicle-detection.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Backup_camera_simulation
    ```
    
### Usage

1. **Run the simulation script:**

    ```bash
    python Backup camera.py
    ```

2. **Adjust the pinion angle using the trackbar to dynamically change the simulation.**


## Project 2: Vehicle detection

### Overview

This project performs vehicle classification using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) object detection framework. The project aims to classify different vehicle types in the Vehicles-OpenImages Object Detection Dataset.

### Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `Vehicle Classification.py`: The main script for training the model.
- `Video1.mp4`: Input video file for classification.
- `Video2.mp4`: Input video file for classification.
- `Video3.avi`: Input video file for classification.
- `Output1.gif`: Output video file for Video1.
- `Output2.mp4`: Output video file for Video2.
- `Output3.avi`: Output video file for Video3.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/Amoghaananthu/Backup-camera-simulation-and-vehicle-detection.git)https://github.com/Amoghaananthu/Backup-camera-simulation-and-vehicle-detection.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd vehicle Classification
    ```
    
### Usage

1. **Run the simulation script:**

    ```bash
    python Vehicle Classification.py
    ```

2. **Make sure to comment the required lines while running the script (look at the Vehicle Classification.py file for more info).**
